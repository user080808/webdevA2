                            <h3>The United States</h3>
                            <h4>Economic and industrial power</h4>
                            <img src="images/useconomy.jpg" alt="useconomy" title="useconomy">
                            <p>Although the United States had vast amounts of resources, it was not ready for war and
                                its people strongly opposed joining the war. However, the Pearl Harbor attack changed
                                public opinion and soon the United States quickly mobilised for war.</p>
                            <p>From May 1942 onwards, the United States supplied the Allies with huge amounts of food,
                                raw materials, weapons, troops, and other essentials for war. In a summit meeting in
                                1943, Stalin proposed a toast: "To American production, without which this war would
                                have been lost."</p>
                            <p>For the duration of the war, US factories produced 250,000 aircraft, 90,000 tanks,
                                350 naval destroyers, 200 submarines and 5,600 merchant ships. By 1944, the United
                                States
                                was producing almost half of the weapons being made globally - more than twice the
                                production
                                of Germany and Japan combined.</p>
                            <p>During the Battle of the Atlantic, US shipyards constructed cargo ships, called Liberty
                                ships, to help transport supplies to the Aliies. In 1943, three ships were completed
                                daily. Soon, the United States was building more ships than the German U-boats could
                                sink.</p>
                            <p>In the Asia-Pacific, the United States supplied the Guomindang (GMD) in China with money,
                                weapons and other aid to fight the Japanese. As the war progressed, resistance movements
                                across Asia such as the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army and Viet Minh would receive
                                backing
                                from the United States.</p>
                            <h4>Island-hopping in the Asia-Pacific</h4>
                            <img src="images/iwojima.jpg" alt="iwojima" title="iwojima">
                            <p>By the time the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, they had already built up a large empire
                                in Asia and the Pacific. Even after the United States victory at Midway, the Allies
                                faced a long and costly campaign against the Japanese and their island strongholds.</p>
                            <p>Thus, they came up with the idea of Island-hopping. Instead of trying to capture every
                                single island, the Allies would target weaker, less-defended islands instead which
                                supplied the stronger islands.</p>
                            <p>This approach was successful, as the well-defended islands gradually weakened over time.
                                It allowed the Allies to conserve their resources and manpowers and avoid costly
                                battles.</p>
                            <h4>The Atomic Bomb</h4>
                            <img src="images/atombomb.jpg" alt="atombomb" title="atombomb">
                            <p>The United States' usage of the atomic bomb was another crucial factor in the Allied
                                victory. Even though they were winning, Japanese resistance would cost them countless
                                casualties and recources.</p>
                            <p>The usage of the atomic bombs without warning swiftly crushed Japanese morale and made
                                them surrender.</p>

                            <h3>Britain</h3>
                            <h4>Strategic position and perseverance</h4>
                            <img src="images/britishperseverance.jpg" alt="britishperseverance"
                                title="britishperseverance">
                            <p>When Britain became the last country standing in Europe of 1940, many politicians
                                believed they should make a deal or an agreement wiht Germany, which could have costed
                                Britain its military, particularly the Royal Navy.</p>
                            <p>However, Churchill refused to do so, preferring that Britain conntinues to fight and
                                resist Germany. This would prove fundamental to Germany's defeat, as Britain's location
                                was a valuable asset.</p>
                            <p>Fighting over home ground gave the British the advantage of short flight times and
                                quicker refuelling and rearming. Britain was also able to tap into their large reserves
                                of spare parts for repair work, allowing them to replace their losses more quickly than
                                Germany, which had stretched it supply lines.</p>
                            <p>The country became a substantial military base. Allied troops from all over the world
                                such as from Canada, the Carribean and the United States were stationed at Britain,
                                which made the D-day landings of 1944 and the Allied bombing campaigns against Germany
                                possible.</p>
                            <h4>Advanced technology</h4>
                            <img src="images/radar.jpg" alt="radar" title="radar">
                            <p>Britain's Royal Air Force (RAF) had excellent fighter aircraft such as the Supermarine
                                Spitfire and the Hawker Hurricane, which were able to put up a strong fight against
                                Germany's
                                newly developed aircraft.</p>
                            <p>In addition, the British also developed the new technology of radar, which was used to
                                detect and locate incoming enemy aircraft. This allowed them to detect German air raids
                                ahead of time, direct aircraft to intercept them, and manage battles effectively.</p>
                            <h4>Colonial manpower and supplies</h4>
                            <img src="images/britishempire.jpg" alt="britishempire" title="britishempire">
                            <p>Britain's survival was instrumental in the war against Japan, as surrendering also meant
                                giving up its many colonies in Asia and giving Japan much less resistance. As it was,
                                the Japanese fought the armies and navies of Britain, Australia, New Zealand and around
                                120,000 African troops from British colonies alongside US troops.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, the British colonies included India, and its immense manpower and resources.
                                India contributed over 2.5 million men and a staggering 80% of its wealth to the Allied
                                war effort.</p>

                            <h3>The Soviet Union</h3>
                            <h4>Reorganisation and reforms</h4>
                            <img src="images/T34.jpg" alt="T34" title="T34">
                            <p>When the German invasion was halted by the Russian winter in 1941, Stalin and his
                                military leaders used the time to reform the Red Army. German tactics were copied over
                                and new strategies and ideas were implemented.</p>
                            <p>Officers in the Red Army were given greater freedom to act. Stalin banned Communist Party
                                officials from interfering with military decisions.</p>
                            <p>Specialist tank armies and air force were created, along with the invention and
                                development of new weapons such as the T-34 tank, which could be mass produced.</p>
                            <p>Harsh discipline was used. For example, Stalin issued Order 227 in July 1942, known as
                                "Not a step back". The army was ordered to fight and die for every bit of Russian soil.
                            </p>
                            <p>Radios were put into tanks and aircraft to enable better communication. Specialist units
                                were also created to listen in and disrupt German radio signals.</p>
                            <h4>The Soviet War Economy</h4>
                            <img src="images/sovietwareconomy.jpg" alt="sovietwareconomy" title="sovietwareconomy">
                            <p>To ensure production kept up with the high demand, harsh measure were enacted. Adults
                                received no food unless they contributed to the war effort in any way. Forced labour was
                                used and the secret police kept close control of the population.</p>
                            <p>This enabled the Soviet Union to produce vast amounts of weapons, with production
                                surpassing Germany in 1942. By 1943, the Soviets were producing one and a half times as
                                many aircraft and twice as many tanks as Germany.</p>
                            <p>The Soviets also shifted its major industrial complexes away to the Urals, Siberia and
                                Kazakhstan. Twenty-five million workers were forced to migrate east which would later
                                contribute to the increased war production.</p>
                            <h4>Contributing to the Asia-Pacific Theatre of War</h4>
                            <img src="images/sovietmanchuria.jpg" alt="sovietmanchuria" title="sovietmanchuria">
                            <p>After the defeat of Germany, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and invaded
                                Manchuria, as agreed at the Tehran Conference and Yalta Conference.</p>
                            <p>The Soviets were able to defeat the Kwantung army at Manchuria and occupy northern Korea,
                                which contributed to Japan's decision to surrender to the Allies.</p>

                            <img src="images/germanpow.jpg" alt="germanpow" title="germanpow">
                            <p>Over the course of the war, the Germans made several critical mistakes, largely due to an
                                inefficient command structure. German commanders had to constantly report back to Hitler
                                who regularly intervened in military decisions.</p>
                            <p>While hitler may be a shrewd politician, he was never a senior military commander and had
                                very little command experience, let alone any at the highest level.</p>
                            <p>One key mistake was during the Dunkirk evacuation. Hitler ordered his panzer divisions to
                                halt their advance to the evacuating British Expeditionary Force and French army. This
                                gave the British and French troops ample time to evacuate to Britain, which was
                                crucial for British morale.</p>
                            <p>Hitler would blunder again when he placed Germany in a two-front war, by failing to
                                defeat Britain yet proceeding to invade the Soviet Union.</p>
                            <p>This prevented him from concentrating his efforts and resources on a single front,
                                causing the military to be stretched thin and gradually worn down by the Allies.</p>
                            <p>Another key mistake was the battle of Stalingrad. As the Soviets stubbornly resisted the
                                Germans, many commanders wanted to withdraw, as the city was ot particularly valuable
                                from a strategic point of view.</p>
                            <p>However, Hitler overruled them. To Hitler, taking Stalingrad was a matter of pride, as
                                the city was named after Stalin. As a result, he committed countless troops to a
                                pointless battle that was eventually lost.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, Hitler erroneously decided to declare war on the United States, even though
                                he had no obligation to do so under the terms of the Tripartite Pact.</p>
                            <p>This would bring the United States, which was previously neutral, into the European
                                theatre of war. Germany would now have to contend with the immsense resources and
                                military might brought about by one of the most industiralised countries in the world.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Poor planning</h4>
                            <img src="images/bismarcksinking.jpg" alt="bismarcksinking" title="bismarcksinking">
                            <p>In addition to Hitler's mistakes, the Germans also failed to plan well in their land,
                                air, and naval powers.</p>
                            <p>In terms of land power, the Germans overengineered their tanks. While they were more
                                advanced and powerful than Allied tanks, they were also overcomplicated, unreliable, and
                                were difficult to mass produce and maintain. Allied
                                tanks on the other hand, such as the T-34 and M4 Sherman, were made for mass production,
                                reliability and ease of use. This meant the Allies could easily replace their losses,
                                while the Germans could not.</p>
                            <p>In terms of naval power, the Germans were highly effective in their usage of U-boats.
                                However, their usage of surface ships was much less so. They entered the war with a
                                largely weak and incomplete naval fleet compared to Britain's Royal Navy, and put too
                                many resources into building huge battleships such as the Bismarck which were quickly
                                disabled early into the
                                war. They also failed to build aircraft carriers which the US and Japan used to dominate
                                the seas.</p>
                            <p>In terms of air power, the Germans never made heavy bombers such as the RAF's Lancaster
                                or the US' B-17. They stuck to medium bombers such as the Heinkel He 111 which were
                                largely inferior in terms of the damage range they had. While they also had a wide
                                variety of aircraft produced, this caused inefficient supply lines and a shortage of
                                spare parts, in addition to their inefficient supply of oil and failure to invest in
                                radar technology. These problems would plague the Luftwaffe later in the war.</p>

                            <h3>Japan</h3>
                            <h4>Interservice rivalry vetween the Army and Navy</h4>
                            <img src="images/ijaijn.jpg" alt="ijaijn" title="ijaijn">
                            <p>Even before the war, the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) and Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN)
                                had a long-standing conflict and rivalry with each other. Both had different strategies
                                and ideas on how to seize territory and resources for the Empire, with the IJA
                                prioritising northern expansion into China and the USSR, and the IJN prioritising
                                southern expansion into the Dutch East Indies and the Pacific.</p>
                            <p>When war broke out, the rivalry prevented the IJN and IJA from sharing resources and
                                exchanging military intelligence, much less coordinate attacks and defences against the
                                Allies. In addition, their refusal to cooperate caused them to manufacture their own air
                                force. This meant the already weak Japanese economy was wasting even more resources
                                building two different sets of equipment for the Army's air force and the Navy's air
                                force.</p>
                            <p>Instances of their rivalry included the IJA's refusal to provide troop support to the IJN
                                for an invasion of Australia, and the IJA's refusal to commit major reinforcements to
                                the Pacific Islands. Both sides also disagreed on where to set Japan's defensive
                                perimeter against the Allied forces.</p>
                            <h4>Overstretched empire</h4>
                            <img src="images/japanoverstretch.jpg" alt="japanoverstretch" title="japanoverstretch">
                            <p>Although Japan managed to acquire vast amounts of territory and resources, they were
                                unable to effectively utilise them due to several reasons.</p>
                            <p>One of those reasons was how spread out the Empire was. In many areas, rail and road
                                communications were poor, resulting in difficulty delivering raw materials and workers
                                efficiently to the required places.</p>
                            <p>It also meant that resources had to be transported by sea, which was much more
                                challenging and risky. This made the Japanese highly-suspectible to the island-hopping
                                strategy employed by the Allies, which allowed them to establish bases on key islands
                                while draining the resources of other ones.</p>
                            <h4>Poor planning</h4>
                            <img src="images/yamato.jpg" alt="yamato" title="yamato">
                            <p>Much like Germany, Japan failed to plan properly for their military. In particular, they
                                failed to understand that war at sea had changed.</p>
                            <p>While Japan managed to damage US battleships at Pearl Harbour, they did not destroy any
                                aircraft carriers which contributed to the US' quick recovery from the attack.</p>
                            <p>Although Japan built aircraft carriers and trained naval pilots, they were extremely slow
                                in doing so, resulting in an irreplaceble carrier fleet that was lost at Midway. Similar
                                to Germany as well, they overinvested in battleships such as the Yamato which ate up
                                huge amounts of resources yet achieved little and were quickly sunk.</p>
                            <p>They were also unable to utilise their submarines effectively. They mostly used them to
                                attack battleships instead of merchant ships, which were much more easier targets and a
                                major opportunity to target the Allied supply lines. The Allies on the other hand,
                                targeted Japanese merchant ships as well along with their navy.</p>
                            <p>This resulted in a huge reduction of Japan's merchant fleet, reduced to one-ninth of its
                                pre-Pearl Harbor capacity by the time they surrendered, and only half of the supplies
                                shipped out was received by their defences, starving and weakening them until they were
                                easy pickings.</p>
                            <h4>Lack of local support</h4>
                            <img src="images/vietminh.jpg" alt="vietminh" title="vietminh">
                            <p>The Japanese also failed to properly use their empire to the fullest, due to their brutal
                                treatment of the peoples they conquered. Locals were abused and thousands were forced
                                into slave labour. Millions of civilians died under Japanese rule.</p>
                            <p>As a result, the locals rebelled against their rule in any way they could, with many
                                joining large-scale resistance movements across their home countries.</p>
                            <p>Examples include Mao Zedong's Chinese Communist Party in China, Ho Chi Minh's Viet Minh
                                in Vietnam, and the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army in Malaya. These groups mostly
                                fought using guerrilla warfare and were effective in harassing Japanese forces,
                                disrupting supply lines and engaging in sabotage.</p>
